### Using JavaScript, HTML, CSS

This is a learning project. My intent is to comment and document the project as much as possible.

There are two main reasons for this.

* Learn to create an interactive JavaScript app.
* Practice commenting code.
* Learn Markdown and how to create decent documentation.

#### Introduction

It is intended that this app have the following features:

* A web user interface using html and css to for input and output
* A form for entering name of the item as a string and the price as integer
* A button to submit the data
* A display of currently entered items and price 
* A calculate button which initiates sun of all prices and displays results
